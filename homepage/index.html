        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello~ my name is Tysha Daniels. I was born and raised in Belmopan. I
          am 19 years old and starting my bachelor's degree in IT…so my zest for
          life has clearly degraded :). A few hobbies of mine are a chronic
          reading addiction (manhwa, mangas, novels…anything under the sun,
          really and truly), a crippling music addiction (I don't think there's
          been a day I haven't listened to music), a minor sudoku, solitaire,
          and mahjong playing problem (especially when I'm bored)…and losing in
          tennis. Pretty minor hobbies if you ask me. Nothing crazy. My goal for
          now is to complete my degree to best of my abilities.
